I worked for Senator Jabari Brisport's grassroots New York Senate campaign in 2020, starting out as a Communications Intern and transitioning to a Policy Researcher role after his nomination. I gained experience writing in a variety of professional capacities, first writing copy for emails and social media for a 40K+ following, and then transitioned to writing policy briefs.
I was independently responsible for a large scale project consisting of briefs on each of the State Legislature's senatorial policy committees, tracking each Senator and their policy alignments. At the culmination of this project, I presented my recommendations on committees of strategic interest to Sen. Brisport's legislative goals directly to his Deputy Campaign Manager.

I recently co-curated and co-produced, with Hank Bhatia and Adi Dahlke, a group show of 15 artists at the penthouse space of the 508 W 26th St building. With the exception of (and thanks to) funding provided by the School of Visual Art's Visual Critical Studies' department, the show was completely independent. We secured the contract, managed the budget, installed the work and managed the team of artists/classmates, led a promotional campaign, secured a liquor license and had a smashing success of an opening.
